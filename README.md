# EE7207 - Advanced Digital Signal Processing

### Learning Objective:

The purpose of this course is to provide in-depth treatment on methods and techniques in discrete-time signal transforms, digital filter design, optimal filtering, power spectrum estimation, multi-rate digital signal processing, DSP architectures, which are of importance in the areas of signal processing, control and communications. Applications of these methods and techniques are also presented. The intended audiences are research students and industry professionals working in the above-mentioned areas and related technical fields.

### Content:

Discrete signal analysis and digital filters. Power spectrum estimation. Linear prediction and optimal linear filters. Multi-rate digital signal processing. DSP Architectures and applications.

### Learning Outcome:

The topics covered in this course provide solid and comprehensive foundation for other more specialized areas in signal processing, control, and communications. At the end of the course, students would be able to apply fundamental principles, methodologies and techniques of the course to analyze and design various problems encountered in both academic research and industry R&D practice.
